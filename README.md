# climber-timer
My attempt at building a popular augmented reality climbing game. Not fully augmented, so it is manually controlled instead of motion controlled. 

This game requires a climbing gym, projector, and a laptop.

Open the html file in your browser (only tested on chrome).
Press F11 to make the game fullscreen, then hit F5 so the size of the circles can properly adjust.
The size of the circles and timer may need to be adjusted depending on the distance of the projector from the climbing wall.
If you refresh the page all of the high scores will clear and the circles and timer will reset in position.

Click and drag to move the numbered circles.
Use the arrow keys to move the timer.
Press the spacebar to start the game.
Press the spacebar while the game is ongoing to remove a circle. After all the cirlces have been removed the game will end.
Press enter to reset the game. If you've typed in a name, the name will be added to the scoreboard.
